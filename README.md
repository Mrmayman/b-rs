# B-RS

A blazingly 🔥 fast 🚀 compiler for the B programming language, written in ~~[Crust](https://github.com/tsoding/crust)~~ [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 🦀

Yes, I un-crustified @tsoding 's Crust project because I had too much time to waste.
Sorry for the heresy :)

Additions: A proper Cargo project, safer STB bindings and cleaner, idiomatic code (just for the fun of it).

> [!WARNING]
> Compiler is not fully implemented yet (may take decades of scientific research).
